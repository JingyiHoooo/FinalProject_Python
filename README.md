# FinalProject_Python

**The code files in this repositry is for downloading the instresed data files from particular Dropbox, save those data with new formatiting after processing the raw data, and plot grapgs to find the relationship bewtween each.



If you want the code for:
downloading E4 files:     **HeartBeatRateData.ipynb
			                    **SkinConductanceData.ipynb

downloading Ebike files: **EBike.ipynb  

plotting to find the relationship 
between human-health related
variables and Human Power :   **DataPlotting.ipynb

I wrote the separate code for downloading each inserted data file is because it is more handy to debug if there is any exception occurs.
